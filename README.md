This is a very simple ball game. A ball bounces around the screen. The objective is to click the ball in which case it disappears and the game is over.

However if you don't click on the ball, a new ball is created and it will also start bouncing around the screen. Now you have to click two balls in order to finish the game.

The catch here is that you get marks for every ball you click, but if you want to get a higher score you have to create more balls. The more balls you create, the harder it will be to ever finish the game!

This will also run on a phone if compiled using PhoneGap. To run it under PhoneGap you need to put all of the files (except cordova.js - phonegap will add it's own copy of this file when it builds the application package) into a ZIP file and upload that to PhoneGap for building.

Have fun!
